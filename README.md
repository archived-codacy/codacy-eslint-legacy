# Codacy ESLint

This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) support.
You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
See the [codacy-engine-scala-seed](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-engine-scala-seed) repository for more information.

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

```
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

The docker is ran with the following command:

```
docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src  <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>
```

## Test

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.

## Adding plugins

To add a plugin to codacy-eslint you just have to:

* Add the `npm install` command for the plugin in the project's [build.sbt](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-eslint/blob/master/build.sbt#L29)
* If you want to be able to configure patterns in Codacy (without needing an ESLint configuration file) you also have to add the new patterns to [patterns.json](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-eslint/blob/master/src/main/resources/docs/patterns.json)
